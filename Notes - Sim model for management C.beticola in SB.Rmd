*Cercospora beticola* is a common limiting factor in the growth and production of
sugarbeet (*Beta vulgaris*). 
Limiting the impact of the pathogen on plant productivity, biomass accumulation 
and subsequently sugar yields requires fungicide applications to be applied at 
first incidence in the field.
Predicting the initial incidence of cercospora leaf spot in the field has been 
the focus of plant disease models since 1972 (@rossi_cercopri_1991).
