*Cercospora beticola* is a common limiting factor in the growth and production of
sugarbeet (*Beta vulgaris*). 
Managing the impact of the pathogen on plant productivity, biomass accumulation 
and subsequently sugar yields requires fungicide applications to be applied at 
first incidence in the field.
Predicting the initial incidence of cercospora leaf spot in the field has been 
the focus of plant disease models since 1972 (@rossi_cercopri_1991).  

Appearance of the disease is seasonal between the middle of June to the middle of 
August in southern Europe (@rossi_cercopri_1991) and is most likely to occur in 
early July.
This pattern might be explained by the temperature and moisture requirements for 
production of conidiophores from pseudostromata surviving in the soil.
This is similar to requirements for *Didimella pinoides* (@salam_g1_2011) or 
*Leptosphaeria maculans* () pseudothecial maturity and ascospore production
(@salam_blackleg_2003, @salam_g1_2011).


Genotype specific effects of partitioning to above ground. 

Racca (@racca_cercbet_2007) CERCBET 3 reports excellent estimation for the onset 
of Cercospora and action thresholds for a fungicidal intervention. Yet the report
stops short of reporting the coefiencts or formulas for reproducing the work.
