Description: This package provides functions to recreate the negative prognosis 
    epidemiological model for describing when the model can't be certain a 
    chance Cercospora leaf spot (_Cercospora beticola_) epidemic has not 
    commenced. The model is based on the work of Wolf and Verreet 
    (2005 <https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PHYTO-95-0269>).
