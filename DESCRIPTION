Description: Estimates sugar beet canopy closure with remotely sensed leaf area
    index and estimates when action might be needed to protect the crop from a 
    Cercospora  leaf spot (_Cercospora beticola_) epidemic with a negative 
    prognosis model based on the work of Wolf and Verreet 
    (2005) Phytopathology, 95, no.3, 269-74.
