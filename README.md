# cercosporaR

## RQs

1) What is the ACTUAL spatial distribution (severity and location) of cercospora beticola (raster maps, descriptive metrics (which?))?
2) Does the cercosporaR model mimic the ACTUAL distribution?
    - single vs multiple in-field enviromental sensors
3) Who do different RS (satellite/UAV) influence cercosporaR in its capability to mimic the ACTUAL spatial distribution?
