# cercosporaR  

## RQs  

1) What is the ACTUAL spatial distribution (severity and location) of 
*Cercospora beticola* (raster maps, descriptive metrics (which?))?  
2) Does the cercosporaR model mimic the ACTUAL distribution?  
    - single vs multiple in-field enviromental sensors  
3) Who do different RS (satellite/UAV) influence cercosporaR in its capability 
to mimic the ACTUAL spatial distribution?
