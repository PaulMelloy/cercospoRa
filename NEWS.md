# cercospoRa (development version)

## Bug fixes  
  - fix variable assignment bug, see issue #41  

## Minor improvements  
  - Improved estimations of cultivar susceptibility on epidemic onset date 
  issue #38 and #42  
  - relative humidity thresholds are now a variable on `calc_epidemic_onset()` 
  #40  
  - Argument in `calc_epidemic_onset_from_image()` `cc_r` changed from `c_closure`
  This is for clarity as the function calc_epidemic_onset has the same argument
  which expects a different input to `calc_epidemic_onset_from_image()`  
  
## Documentation improvements
  - Clarify cultivar susceptibility references and bsa index.  
  - Update README  
  - Add spelling package to suggests  
  - Corrected unit tests  
  - Expand vignette to look at range of pixelwise epidemic onsets.  
  - Formatting and grammar improvements  
  
# cercospoRa 0.0.1


## minor improvements
  - moved format_weather function into `cercospoRa` package to avoid `epiphytoolR`
  suggests problems with CRAN.  
  - Moved some _./ext_ data to internal data for testing only to reduce package 
  size.  
  - weathr data attribution updated  

# cercospoRa 0.0.0.9003
## New Features and minor improvements
  - Four functions have been added to deal with spatial heterogeneity:
    - `read_sb_growth_parameter`: read in and format raster images to allow 
     further computation.
    - `calc_r_x0`: fit logistic growth curve to the date.
    - `calc_c_closure`: to deduct canopy closure dates from the fitted curves.
    - `calc_epidemic_onset_from_image`: builds on the existing `calc_epidemic_onset` 
    function to compute a value for each pixel.
  - Example datasets have been provided to check the functions. 
  It consists of a folder containing two LAI maps computed from UAV images.  

## Features removed  
  - Removed methods from Racca paper and set them to a new branch 
  [plus_racca](https://github.com/PaulMelloy/cercospoRa/tree/plus_racca)

## Documentation fixes  
  - add metadata  
  - Further simplification of `main` and `dev` branches to only the Wolf and 
  Verreet functions.  
  - add badge  
  - spelling and grammar fixes
