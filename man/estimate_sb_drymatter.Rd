\title{Estimate sugar beat dry matter aculumation}
\usage{
estimate_sb_drymatter(RG, LAI, incid_rad = 0.48, k = 0.7, RUE = 3.36)
}
\arguments{
\item{RG}{Global incident radiation (RG)}

\item{LAI}{leaf area index for the crop cycle \emph{n}. The ratio of total leaf area
of plants divided by the land surface area. Typically between 0 and 9.}

\item{incid_rad}{incident photosynthetic radiation during crop cycle \emph{n}. Assumed
to be 0.48 (default)}

\item{k}{Beer-Lambert extinction coefficient}

\item{RUE}{radiation use efficiency of sugar beet. Default = 3.36 as observed
by Lemaire et. al (2009). Typical values for k are in the range of 0.5 to 0.9}
}
