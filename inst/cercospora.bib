	abstract = {ABSTRACT A simple model has been developed to predict the onset of pseudothecia maturity and seasonal ascospore showers in relation to blackleg disease in canola, caused by the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans. The model considers a combination of two weather factors, daily mean temperature and daily total rainfall, to drive progress of maturity of pseudothecia on the infested canola stubble left from past crops. Each day is categorized as suitable or not suitable for progress of the maturation process. The onset of pseudothecia maturity occurs when approximately 43 suitable days have occurred. Following the onset of maturity, ascospore showers are triggered when daily rainfall exceeds a threshold. The model satisfactorily predicted the timing of the onset of pseudothecia maturity when tested with 3 years of field observations at four locations in Western Australia, which characteristically has a Mediterranean climate. The model also agreed reasonably well with the daily pattern of ascospore release observed in two locations. Sensitivity analysis was performed to show the relative importance of the parameters that describe the onset of pseudothecia maturity.},

The model considers a combination of two weather factors, daily mean temperature and daily total rainfall, to drive progress of maturity of pseudothecia on infested field pea stubble from past crops. Each day is categorised as suitable or not suitable for continuation of the maturation process. The onset of pseudothecial maturity has been found to take place when approximately ten suitable days have occurred. Following the onset of maturity, ascospore release is triggered when daily rainfall exceeds a threshold. The model was satisfactorily calibrated using three datasets from Western Australia. The calibrated model performed well when independently tested with 21 datasets, 17 from Western Australia and 4 from South Australia. It is concluded that G1 Blackspot Manager model has the potential to be used to formulate sowing guides for field pea in southern Australia that minimise the risk of ascochyta blight.},

	abstract = {Cercospora leaf spot (CLS; caused by Cercospora beticola Sacc.) is the most widespread and damaging foliar disease of sugar beet. Early assessments of CLS risk are thus pivotal to the success of disease management and farm profitability. In this study, we propose a weather-based modelling approach for predicting infection by C. beticola in sugar beet fields in Belgium. Based on reported weather conditions favoring CLS epidemics and the climate patterns across Belgian sugar beet-growing regions during the critical infection period (June to August), optimum weather conditions conducive to CLS were first identified. Subsequently, 14 models differing according to the combined thresholds of air temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and rainfall (R) being met simultaneously over uninterrupted hours were evaluated using data collected during the 2018 to 2020 cropping seasons at 13 different sites. Individual model performance was based on the probability of detection (POD), the critical success index (CSI), and the false alarm ratio (FAR). Three models (i.e., M1, M2 and M3) were outstanding in the testing phase of all models. They exhibited similar performance in predicting CLS infection events at the study sites in the independent validation phase; in most cases, the POD, CSI, and FAR values were ≥84\%, ≥78\%, and ≤15\%, respectively. Thus, a combination of uninterrupted rainy conditions during the four hours preceding a likely start of an infection event, RH {\textgreater} 90\% during the first four hours and RH {\textgreater} 60\% during the following 9 h, daytime T {\textgreater} 16 °C and nighttime T {\textgreater} 10 °C, were the most conducive to CLS development. Integrating such weather-based models within a decision support tool determining fungicide spray application can be a sound basis to protect sugar beet plants against C. beticola, while ensuring fungicides are applied only when needed throughout the season.},

The daily increase of disease severity depends on the infection rate, on the infectious leaf area and on the affectable leaf area. Infection rate is calculated as a function of some weather (hourly values of temperature and relative humidity and rainfall) and cultural factors (cultivar susceptibility and sugarbeet growth stage). The validation of the model, using data not used for model development, was made by subjective (visual comparison) and objective tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression analysis). A comparison was made between field observations and simulations produced by CERCODEP. Visual comparison and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test always showed agreement of model simulations with field observations, while regression analysis showed one case of a significant difference.},

	abstract = {Yield prediction in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) is important as a basis for in-season N application. Active optical sensors have been researched in sugar beet for yield estimation. A common field method for using active-optical sensors is to establish an N non-limiting area, and compare the yield predicted from sensor readings with readings from the rest of the field. Yield difference is the basis for calculation of N rate. Sugar beet gains root mass and sugar content with time. The objectives of these experiments were to utilize two active-optical sensors at two timings with canopy height measurements and relate readings to root yield and recoverable sugar yield at consecutive harvest dates. A 2-yr study in the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota was conducted on four sites to compare two active-optical sensors, GreenSeeker and Holland Crop Circle, red normalized differential vegetative index (NDVI), red edge NDVI, with and without canopy height for use in sugar beet yield prediction. The red NDVI and red edge NDVI, used at V 6–8 and V 12–14 were similar in their relationship to sugar beet yield over several harvest dates. The r2 of sensor measurement and yield relationships at V 6–8 improved when canopy height was considered but not at V 12–14. Active-optical sensors when canopy height is considered could be used to predict sugar beet root yield and recoverable sugar yield over a range of harvest dates, which would be useful in developing algorithms for in-season N fertilization.},

This research aimed to test the Beta model for its adequacy in predicting the time of emergence for sugar beet. The Beta growth model as a phenological model have been used for evaluating the time of seedling emergences under both controlled environments in laboratory and field conditions. An experiment was conducted both in the laboratory with five soil textures, three sowing depths, five soil water contents and ten constant soil temperatures, under field conditions on five sowing dates (20 February, 28 March, 19 April, 10 May, and 31 May) and three sowing depths. The results demonstrated that the Beta model can predict the time of emergence. Based on the root mean square error (RMSE), the time of emergence estimated by the Beta model was in high agreement with the time of emergence measured in the laboratory. Estimation accuracy was reduced slightly by the Beta model under field conditions. The accuracy of the Beta model was influenced by the sowing date under field conditions. So, on the first and second sowing dates (with low air temperature), the estimation of time of emergence by the model was lower and on the fourth and the fifth sowing date (with warmer air temperature), was more than the duration measured. Estimation accuracy was increased by the Beta model under field conditions using soil temperature. In conclusion, the Beta model can predict the time to emergence of sugar beet seedlings in different levels of soil texture and soil water content under field conditions, and with that, the proper planting date for sugar beet seeds to overcome weeds in different soil water content can be predicted.},

Our objective was to evaluate the use of an optical sensor for assessment of in-season sugarbeet N status, yield, and quality prediction and total N in foliage on the day of harvest. Six N fertilizer treatments, from 0 to 225 kg N ha−1, were applied at three sites in Michigan in 2006 and four sites in 2007. Normalized difference vegetative indices (NDVIs) were measured at four growing degree day (GDD) intervals in 2006, five intervals in 2007, and at harvest in both years with a red-band active sensor. Leaf biomass and root yield were determined at harvest, and root samples were collected for determination of sucrose content and clear juice purity. The NDVI readings were useful for differentiating control treatments from fertilized plots but were not able to identify a yield response threshold until late in the season. Midseason 1200 to 1400 GDD, 1900 to 2300 GDD, and harvest NDVI values were strongly related to recoverable white sucrose per area (R2 = 0.89, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively). Harvest NDVI was strongly related to sugarbeet vegetation total N (R2 = 0.87). Active sensing during the growing season shows promise as a means to estimate root yield and recoverable sugar in sugarbeet fields. Sensing on the day of harvest may improve rotational N management by providing an indication of N return to the cropping system.},

Extensive validation in 2001–03 showed that, in 80–95\% of the cases, CERCBET 3 correctly forecasted the dates when thresholds were overridden. Cultivar diversity in German sugar beet growing is increasing, thus a module has been included into CERCBET 3 which reflects susceptibility to C. beticola by introducing a sporulation factor. In some cases a second or even third fungicide treatment could be necessary to control Cercospora leaf spot and so a further module which models fungicide efficacy has been elaborated.
